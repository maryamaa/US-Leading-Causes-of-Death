## An Investigation into the Correlation between Covid19-Related Deaths in 2020 and the Leading Causes of Death in the United States from 2015-2019
Have you ever wondered how the Covid19 pandemic impacted the leading causes of death in the United States? This question inspired my latest research project, where I investigated the correlation between Covid19-related deaths in 2020 and the leading causes of death in the country from 2015-2019. Through careful analysis of available data, I uncovered some interesting findings that shed light on the relationship between the pandemic and public health in the United States. My hope is that this study can inform future public health policies and initiatives that aim to prevent and address the leading causes of death in the country.
### Project Motivation
As someone who is passionate about public health, I have been closely following the Covid19 pandemic and its impact on our lives. One area that particularly caught my attention is how the pandemic has affected the leading causes of death in the United States. This motivated me to conduct a study exploring the correlation between Covid19-related deaths in 2020 and the leading causes of death in the country from 2015-2019. By delving deeper into this topic, I aimed to contribute to our understanding of how the pandemic has impacted public health in the United States. Ultimately, I hope that my research can inform future policies and initiatives aimed at improving public health and preventing unnecessary deaths in the country.
### About Data
The main data set is derived from U.S. government’s open data website. the of data for the causes of deaths between 2014-2019. In each row we can see a week’s number of deaths cause by on of the select death causes.  We looked at this data to identify any patterns or trends in the leading causes of death. We also used two other datasets to help us with our analysis. The first was the yearly data of population for these states. This information helped us understand the demographics of the populations we were analyzing and how they might affect the results.
The second additional dataset was essentially the same as the first one, but for 2020, and it included Covid-19 deaths. We compared this dataset with our original one to see if there was any correlation between the leading causes of death and Covid-19 mortality rates.
by using these three datasets together, we were able to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between Covid-19 and the leading causes of death in the United States.

### Project Description
This project is an interesting study that explores the possible link between the leading causes of death in the United States and the mortality rate of Covid-19 in 2020.
The project uses correct indices and measurements in health policy to understand the historical and present profiles of diseases and health issues. By doing so, the study aims to identify potential implications and relationships between these causes and the mortality rate of Covid-19 in 2020.
It's worth noting that the Covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise in 2020, despite warnings from public health experts and risk modelers. The study also takes into account the CDC's claim that underlying conditions have contributed to the deaths caused by Covid-19.
The project is significant because it explores how the top death causes in different states in the U.S. from 2014 to 2019 could have implications for the mortality rate of Covid-19 in 2020. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the relationship between Covid-19 and the leading causes of death in the United States, and highlights the importance of using data-driven insights to make informed decisions in health policy.
